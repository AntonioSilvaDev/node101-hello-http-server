# Welcome :wave:

This is my second Node project.  Its a basic app that shows plain text on an HTML page

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by typing '$ npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type '$ node .' to start the app on the local node server and open the localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice.
